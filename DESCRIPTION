Version: 0.1.0
Author: Anonymous <anonymous@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Anonymous <anonymous@gmail.com>
Description: We provide implementation for transfer learning with 
    high-dimensional quantile regression given the target and sources samples.
    Namely, the naive function to obtain the Oracle Trans-Lasso QR estimator 
    is provided, and to prevent negative transfer, the informative set 
    detection procedure is also provided when the number of set is known or 
    not known.
