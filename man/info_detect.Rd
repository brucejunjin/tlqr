\title{Main function for informative sources detection among all dataset}
\usage{
info_detect(
  x_target,
  y_target,
  x_aux_bd,
  y_aux_bd,
  u_target,
  u_aux_bd,
  epsilon = 0.01,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_target}{A n*p matrix as the covariate from the target population.}

\item{y_target}{A vector with length n as the response from the target
population.}

\item{x_aux_bd}{A list object that each element is a n*p matrix as the
covariate from informative sources.}

\item{y_aux_bd}{A list object that each element is a vector with length n
as the covariate from informative sources.}

\item{u_target}{A scalar in (0,1). The quantile level for model of target
population.}

\item{u_aux_bd}{A vector that contains the quantile level for informative
populations.}

\item{epsilon}{A scalar. Default is 0.01. The strict level for informative
sources detectiond, larger the value is, less strict the procedure is.}

\item{h}{A vector with length (K+1), where K is the number of auxiliary
datasets. It pre-determine the bandwidth. The default is NULL, if NULL,
cross validation will be carried out.}

\item{parallel}{A logic variable, default is TRUE}

\item{ncore}{The integer, the number of cores used for parallel computation.}

\item{info_num}{An integar. Default is NULL. The given number of informative
sources under pseduo running.}

\item{seed}{A integer variable for the random seed, default is 111.}

\item{verbose}{A logic variable, default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A vector of index. The index of the informative sources.
