\title{Build the auxiliary function to compute quantile loss for informative sources detection}
\usage{
Q_loss(betahat, betaic, X_measure, y_measure, u_target, hic = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{betahat}{Estimator for target only from training part.}

\item{betaic}{Estimator for target only from testing part.}

\item{X_measure}{A n*p matrix for covariate of population that is waiting for the test.}

\item{y_measure}{A vector as the response from the population that is waiting for the test.}

\item{u_target}{A scalar in (0,1). The quantile level for informative source detection testing.}

\item{hic}{A scalar >0. The smoothing bandwidth for calculate the loss.}
}
\value{
A scalar. The quantile loss for given estimator on the given testing samples.
